# SocialDataScience_Project
This project is part of the lecture "Social Data Science" at the ETH Zurich. The project investigates th following questions using data gather with the Twitter API and analyzed in R.

Does the sentiment of tweets from members of the Swiss parliament (national council &amp; council of states) concerning the introduction and loosening of measures against the spread of COVID-19 correlate with their party affiliation? And further, did the sentiment change over the course of the last year for certain parties?

Motivation:
Introduction and loosening of measures against the spread of COVID-19 by the Swiss Federal Council are in dispute between different political parties. While some parties are in favor of a harsher approach in fighting the spread of the pandemic, others advocate for less strict measures in order to support the national economy. In our research, we will investigate whether this difference can be observed in tweets posted by members of the Swiss parliament following media conferences of the Federal Council at which new measures or loosening of measures were published. Further, we will examine whether the sentiment of the tweets of the different members and parties changed over the course of the last year (March 2020 â€“ February 2021).
